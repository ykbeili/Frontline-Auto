# Frontline Auto

## From intake to live, faster.

Frontline Auto is a Rails application that orchestrates Recon & Make-Ready for used vehicles at dealerships. It coordinates the journey from Intake → Inspection → Parts → Service → Detail → Photo → Live, with SLA timers, checklists, parts ETAs, alerts, and a publish gate—so vehicles hit the lot faster with consistent media quality.
